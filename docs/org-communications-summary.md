   - Add actual links
   - Set appropriate permissions
   - Pin to relevant workspace sections

3. **Prepare emails:**
   - Extract role-specific sections from `org-communications-rollout.md`
   - Customize for your audience
   - Schedule send times

4. **Schedule events:**
   - Enablement session for repo owners (1-2 hours)
   - Enablement session for contributors (1 hour)
   - Office hours for questions (recurring)

## Customization Notes

### Timeline Adjustments
The timeline assumes a 2-week sprint. Adjust based on:

### Organization-Specific
- Exception approval workflow
- Reviewer requirements (may vary by repo)
- CI/CD details (adjust for your setup)

- Support channels (use your preferred channels)

### Additional Considerations
- Consider piloting on subset of repos first
- Prepare additional training materials if needed
- Offer migration support sessions
- Set up feedback collection mechanism
- Keep documentation updated as policies evolve
